### Code Journal

- Have created repo `if-else-if`
- Added html, js files 
- Created a form with dropdown options
- It contains collection of  colors
- Then i applied condition to get user input `if-else-if`
- In next step i want to set background color of page when function invoked
- First i applied color on text and when it was working i applied it on background 
- Also i am getting  print out output on console and form when color selected

- I was practicing form examples where i was creating login form when function invoked it takes you to next page then i was trying to change color of that page where i get in problem, was not sure how to link multiple html and js files? maybe i am just getting ahead of myself
